# **Exercise 2.3: Cartesian To Polar Coordinates**

##**Question:**

Write a program to perform a cartesian to polar coordinate transformation. That is, ask the user for the Cartesian coordinates $x, y$ of a point in two-dimensional space, and calculate and print the corresponding polar coordinates, with the angle $\theta$ given in degrees.

##**Physics Explication:**
