# **Exercise 2.7: Catalan Numbers

## **Question:**
The Catalan numbers $C_{n}$ are a sequence of integers 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 132... that play an import role in quantum mechanics and the theory of disordered systems. (They were central to Eugene Wigner's proof of the so-called semicircle law) They are give by

$$C_{0} = 1$$ $$C_{n+1} = \frac{4n+2}{n+2}C_{n}$$

Write a program that prints in increasing order all Catalan number less than or equal to one billion
